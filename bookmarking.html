                    Colleen Hoover’s Ugly Love (2014) is a standalone romance novel set in contemporary San Francisco. The story predominantly alternates between the primary 
                    characters Elizabeth Tate Collins and Miles Mikel Archer. Tate, a registered nurse pursuing her master’s degree, is in her early 20s. Miles, an airline pilot, 
                    is in his mid-20s. The chapters from Tate’s point of view are set in the present, while the chapters from Miles’s point of view are set six years in the past.
                     The third person narrative voice is direct and unflinching, but Miles’s chapters incorporate a poignant poetic narrative in addition to prose. Through Tate and Miles’s
                      clandestine romance, Hoover explores the themes of The Duality of Pleasure and Pain, Relationship Boundaries Versus Emotional Walls, and Fear and Control as Roadblocks to Love. 

                    Hoover is a New York Times bestselling author based in Texas. She has written many romance novels and romantic thrillers for both adults and young adults, 
                    including Reminders of Him (2022), It Starts With Us (2022), Verity (2021), It Ends With Us (2016), November 9 (2015), and Confess (2015). Hoover has redefined the 
                    contemporary romance genre through the incorporation of complex characters who face intense emotional dilemmas. Her novels are popular for their incisive, honest, 
                    and exciting stories of love that endure despite people’s human flaws. Through her novels, Hoover explores deeper themes of grief and loss, forgiveness,
                     the effects of trauma, resilience, and domestic violence.

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    Tate Collins moves from San Diego to San Francisco to attend graduate school. In San Francisco, she plans to stay with her older brother, Corbin, while she looks
                     for a job as a registered nurse (RN). Corbin, an airline pilot, is away for the weekend when she arrives, and she meets the friendly elevator attendant, Cap.
                      Cap looks at Tate’s birthmark and remarks, “Somebody stabbed you in the neck, young lady” (1). He shares his grandfather’s wisdom and explains that people’s
                       birthmarks indicate how they died in a previous life. Tate regards the elderly man as harmless and makes polite small talk with him before getting in the elevator.
                        A married man named Dillon enters the elevator. He tries to flirt with Tate, but she is leery of his advances. 

             Tate makes it up to her floor safely, but there’s a drunk man sleeping against the apartment door. She calls her brother and stays on the phone with him while she tries to ease past the man.
              He grabs her ankle, and she slams the door on him, only to realize she left her purse and suitcase in the hallway. Corbin calls his neighbor and friend from flight school, Miles, to help Tate.

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    Tate can sense that Miles is a good person with a painful history, but he refuses to talk about his past. She feels especially wounded the night they have unprotected sex, and afterwards,
                     he slams the door and leaves her alone without explanation. Miles is upset because when he had unprotected sex Rachel, she got pregnant. Despite their on-and-off again dynamic throughout the novel,
                      Miles acts very much like an overprotective boyfriend. After Tate and Miles’s dramatic unprotected sex scene, they don’t talk for a while. When Miles sees Tate studying with one of her male nursing friends, 
                      Miles barges into Tate’s apartment and demands to know if she’s sleeping with him. Although Miles is bothered by the idea of Tate being with someone else, he still won’t admit that he wants to be in a relationship with her. 

          When Tate eventually reveals her true feelings to Miles, he replies that he was upfront with her from the beginning and is not interested in a relationship. Corbin learns about Tate and Miles’s sexual relationship when
           he walks in on them in the apartment. Corbin is angry but learns to accept them together. Tate thinks Miles is opening up emotionally, but just when they’re on the verge of a breakthrough, he closes down again. 
           Tate moves out to her own apartment a few blocks away. She says goodbye to Miles, but he acts completely emotionless and unaffected when she leaves. Two weeks later, Miles shows up at her door when she is settling into her new place.

After his best friend Ian’s berating and Cap’s encouragement, Miles decides to visit Rachel. Rachel is happily married to a man named Brad and has a baby girl, Claire. She tells Miles that she understands what he’s feeling,
 but those feelings don’t have to consume his life. When Miles realizes he’s missing happiness with Tate, he asks Corbin for her address and shows up to confess some of his history and feelings. Miles professes his love, and Tate cries tears of happiness. Miles wipes her tears and kisses her.

Six months later, Miles takes Tate and Cap up in an airplane. Miles has known Cap for much longer than he has let on, and this will be Cap’s first time in an airplane. After Cap gets off the plane, Miles comes back and gives Tate a key to his apartment.
 He asks her to move in with him. She says yes, and then he also proposes to her. She happily accepts. 

The Epilogue takes place about two years later. Tate and Miles have a baby girl named Sam after Cap’s real name, Samuel. Miles was afraid he wouldn’t be able to handle loving another baby again, but when he sees and holds Sam,
 he knows he is capable of love and true happiness again. Tate is happy, and Miles has the family he always wanted.
